# Module 1 - Viva Preparation ðŸŽ¤

## Basic Questions (Warm-up) ðŸŒŸ

**Q1: What is a Database?**
**A:** A database is an organized collection of structured data stored electronically that can be easily accessed, managed, and updated.

**Q2: What is DBMS?**
**A:** Database Management System - software that handles storage, retrieval, and organization of data in a database.

**Q3: Give example of popular DBMS?**
**A:** MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, MongoDB (NoSQL).

## Conceptual Questions (Medium) ðŸ§ 

**Q4: Why use Database instead of File System?**
**A:** 
- **Eliminates data redundancy** and inconsistency
- **Provides data security** and access control
- **Supports concurrent access** by multiple users
- **Automatic backup and recovery** mechanisms
- **Data integrity** maintenance

**Q5: Explain Data Abstraction levels?**
**A:**
- **External Level:** User's view of database (what they see)
- **Conceptual Level:** Overall logical structure (complete database design)  
- **Internal Level:** Physical storage details (how data is stored on disk)

**Q6: What is Data Independence?**
**A:**
- **Physical Independence:** Can change storage structure without affecting logical structure
- **Logical Independence:** Can modify database schema without affecting user applications

**Q7: What does DBA do?**
**A:** Database Administrator manages:
- **Database installation** and configuration
- **User access control** and security
- **Performance tuning** and optimization
- **Backup and recovery** procedures
- **Problem troubleshooting**

## Advanced Questions (Challenging) ðŸš€

**Q8: Compare File System vs Database System?**
**A:** Create a comparison table highlighting:
- Data redundancy vs minimal redundancy
- No concurrent access vs multiple user access
- Limited security vs robust security mechanisms
- Manual backup vs automatic backup systems

**Q9: Draw DBMS Architecture diagram?**
**A:** Draw three-level architecture:
```
Users â†’ External Views â†’ Conceptual Schema â†’ Internal Schema â†’ Physical Storage
```
Explain each level and data independence between levels.

**Q10: Real-world Database Applications?**
**A:** Mention specific examples:
- **Banking:** Account management, transaction processing
- **E-commerce:** Product catalog, order management  
- **Healthcare:** Patient records, appointment scheduling
- **Social Media:** User profiles, content management

## Technical Deep-Dive Questions ðŸ’»

**Q11: What are Database Characteristics?**
**A:** Key characteristics include:
- **Data Integration:** Related information stored together
- **Data Sharing:** Multiple users can access simultaneously
- **Data Security:** Authentication and authorization controls
- **Data Consistency:** Same information across all applications
- **Data Independence:** Flexibility in system modifications

**Q12: Types of Databases you know?**
**A:**
- **Relational:** MySQL, PostgreSQL (table-based)
- **NoSQL:** MongoDB (document), Redis (key-value)
- **Graph:** Neo4j (relationship-focused)
- **Distributed:** Data across multiple locations

**Q13: OLTP vs OLAP?**
**A:**
- **OLTP:** Online Transaction Processing - real-time operations (banking transactions)
- **OLAP:** Online Analytical Processing - data analysis and reporting (business intelligence)

## Scenario-Based Questions ðŸŽ¯

**Q14: You're designing a library management system. How would you use database concepts?**
**A:**
- **External Level:** Student sees book catalog, Librarian sees complete system
- **Conceptual Level:** Books, Students, Borrowing relationships
- **Internal Level:** File organization, indexing for fast search
- **DBA Role:** Manage user accounts, backup student records, ensure system security

**Q15: Why can't we use Excel files for a bank instead of database?**
**A:**
- **No concurrent access** - multiple users can't work simultaneously
- **No security controls** - anyone can access/modify data
- **No transaction support** - can't handle complex banking operations
- **Limited scalability** - can't handle millions of accounts
- **No automatic backup** - risk of data loss

## Problem-Solving Questions ðŸ”§

**Q16: A company has data redundancy issues. How database helps?**
**A:**
- **Centralized storage** eliminates duplicate data
- **Referential integrity** ensures data consistency
- **Normalization** removes redundant information
- **Single source of truth** for all applications

**Q17: How does Data Independence help in system maintenance?**
**A:**
- **Physical Independence:** Can upgrade hardware without changing applications
- **Logical Independence:** Can add new tables/fields without breaking existing programs
- **Reduces maintenance cost** and system downtime

**A:** Database Management System

**Q19: Who is DBA?**
**A:** Database Administrator

**Q20: Three levels of architecture?**
**A:** External, Conceptual, Internal

**Q21: Two types of Data Independence?**
**A:** Physical and Logical

**Q22: Example of File System problem?**
**A:** Data redundancy and inconsistency

**Q23: Popular NoSQL database?**
**A:** MongoDB
